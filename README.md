# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project includes both one player and two player versions of the game 'Tic-Tac-Toe'. One player version currently consists of two modes- 'Noob' and 'Unbeatable'. 
 
As the name suggests, the 'Noob' version makes random choices against the move made by the human player. On the other hand, the 'Unbeatable' version runs on the Minimax algorithm. This enables the computer to precompute all the results of the game and hence make a favourable move.

The future versions of the project aim to add more than two difficulty levels. This can be done by fixing the upper limit of the depth to which the game tree is traversed. Other methods such as adding random noises here and there will also spice up the things.
